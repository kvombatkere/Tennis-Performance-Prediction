    "Below is an implementation of Python code on a dataset with detailed tennis match information from the ATP World Tour.\n",
    "This notebook contains scripts that import, clean and process the match data to extract the required features to be used in the ML models. The pandas library was used extensively to store, clean and process the data. \n",

    "First unique tennis player information was extracted into a Pandas dataframe. The following attributes were extracted from the match data - 'PlayerID', 'PName', 'Age', 'Height', 'MaxRank', 'Hand', 'Country'\n",
    "\n",
    "Then a function computePlayerStats() was written to calculate the following cumulative (average) statistics of a players: 'PlayerID', 'PName', 'Height(cm)', 'Matches Played', 'Overall Win%', 'Top 100 Win %', 'Top 30 Win %', 'First Serve %', 'First Serve Win %', 'BPSave %', 'BPConv %', 'Aces/Match', 'DF/Match', 'Future Top 30'\n",
    "\n",
    "The required features were extracted for valid players (having played ~50 matches under the age of 26) and these tuples were returned as a new dataframe. Finally, this dataframe was exported as a .csv file, to be used as training and test data for the Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression and Neural Network)."
